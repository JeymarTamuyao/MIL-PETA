    <h2>Example of Media Power: People Power Revolution</h2>
    <p>The 1986 People Power Revolution in the Philippines is a historic example of how media can mobilize people. During this time, citizens protested against the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos. Media played a crucial role in spreading information about government abuses and rallying people to support change. Without the information broadcasted on the radio and television, the peaceful revolution might not have gained the traction it did. This event showcases how powerful media can be in uniting people for a common cause, demonstrating its potential to influence political landscapes.</p>

  <!-- Section 5: Dimensions of Information and Media -->
  <section class="section content">
    <h2>Dimensions of Information and Media</h2>
    <h3>Text Information and Media</h3>
    <p>Text media include books, articles, and websites that provide written information. They are often produced by authors, journalists, and experts and can be organized by publishers or online platforms. Dissemination may happen through printed materials or digital media, reaching audiences formally (in education) or informally (on social media).</p>
    
    <h3>Visual Information and Media</h3>
    <p>Visual media, such as photos, infographics, and illustrations, convey information through images. Produced by artists, photographers, and designers, visual media are organized in galleries, social networks, or digital libraries and spread widely through the internet and media outlets.</p>

    <h3>Audio Information and Media</h3>
    <p>Audio media, including radio broadcasts, podcasts, and music, use sound to communicate messages. Often produced by musicians, broadcasters, and podcasters, audio media is organized by radio stations, streaming platforms, or podcast directories, accessible via radio, mobile apps, or websites.</p>

    <h3>Motion Information and Media</h3>
    <p>Motion media, like films, animations, and videos, combine visuals and audio to deliver stories and information. Produced by filmmakers, animators, and content creators, motion media is organized on streaming services, cinemas, or social media platforms, disseminated through TV, internet, or theaters.</p>

    <h3>Manipulative Information and Media</h3>
    <p>Manipulative media involve interactive content like games and simulations. Developed by game designers and educators, theyâ€™re organized in app stores and gaming platforms, allowing users to engage with the content directly, which can affect perceptions and learning informally.</p>

    <h3>Multimedia Information and Media</h3>
    <p>Multimedia combines text, images, audio, video, and interaction, commonly used in websites, online courses, and digital marketing. Produced by a mix of media professionals, multimedia content is organized across websites, apps, and platforms, disseminating information interactively and reaching wide audiences.</p>

  <!-- Section 6: Analyzing Production and Dissemination of Media -->
  <section class="section content">
    <h2>Production, Organization, and Dissemination of Media</h2>
    <p>Media production can be formal, like newspapers with editorial guidelines, or informal, like blogs. Information is organized systematically on platforms like databases or more loosely on social media. Dissemination happens via print, broadcast, or digital means, each shaping how audiences interpret and interact with media. For example, formal dissemination often implies credibility, while informal channels are accessible but may lack verification. This layered structure impacts public perception, making it essential to approach media critically.</p>
